I recently got really into the whole **serverless** tech thing after reading a couple of super insightful pieces. One was a deep dive by Deloitte into the [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for serverless compared to traditional cloud setups](https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/AWS_MAD_Deloitte_TCO_paper.pdf).

The other was a wild case where someone managed to handle [39 million requests in just a month for only $370](https://archive.postlight.com/insights/serving-39-million-requests-for-370-month-or-how-we-reduced-our-hosting-costs-by-two-orders-of). These articles didn't just highlight the cost benefits but completely changed how I saw serverless tech.

## Just Go Serverless

Deloitte's study laid out how to figure out if serverless is cheaper than old-school cloud methods. The savings weren’t mind-blowing, but they were definitely there, and pretty compelling when you think about not just upfront costs (**CAPEX**) but also ongoing costs (**OPEX**).

Then there’s the story of serving up 39 million requests for less than 400 bucks. It's a pretty bold claim and it shows just how much you can save if you play your cards right with serverless.

I used to be pretty doubtful about serverless, mainly because of some horror stories about hidden costs, like those with AWS Lambda where your supposed 'free tier' with 1 million requests disappears faster than you’d think. Those kinds of stories made me a bit cynical at first.

But now, I think differently. Serverless isn't just about cutting costs. It’s about being nimble and getting things up and running fast. The speed you can hit the market with serverless is a game-changer, making it a top pick for setting up tech projects.

## Sounds all too good to be true right

Still, I keep wondering if it’s all too good to be true. Am I just buying into the hype too easily? Is serverless going to completely take over traditional cloud services? I don't have all the answers yet, but I’m staying tuned to see where things go.

For now, I'm pretty jazzed about serverless and excited to see how it evolves. Whether it becomes the future of all computing or just a cool stepping stone, its impact on making things cheaper and faster is hard to ignore. I’m looking forward to more surprises and maybe even some challenges as I dive deeper into what serverless can do.
